## About Project 

This project is based on machine learning and its algorithms, especially Reinforcement learning and its algorithms, that predicts which AD is creating more impact on the users among many different ADs shown to them using **Thompson Sampling Method**.

Thompson Sampling method is based on probabilistic approach and finally i got the result which Ad was creating more impact on the users.
